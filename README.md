# Tiago's Incredible Boot Screen...

or **TIBS** for short is a boot animation program and a display manager meant to replace plymouth and sddm/gdm and other display managers.

TIBS has the goal to provide a polished boot experience for your computer and reduce the jank associated with
normal plymouth.
